# National-Parks

## Description
As an outdoorsy person and van traveler, I wanted to make an app that more easily navigates the parks to find what is around you and what types of things they offer. Users can explore real National Parks within the US and learn about what they offer. Hopefully it inspires someone to take a trip!
